    _id:
      type: string
      format: objectId
      description: Unique identifier for the service area.
    provider:
      type: string
      format: objectId

      type: array
      items:
        type: string
        format: objectId
        description: ObjectId referencing Area (not the areas field)
      description: |
        Array of ObjectIds referencing Area model. This is distinct from the `areas` field, which may be used for other purposes.

        **Note:** For `availableLocations` (array), you can send either:
        - Multiple fields: `-F 'availableLocations=ID1' -F 'availableLocations=ID2' ...` (recommended, best for backend)
        - Single comma-separated field: `-F 'availableLocations=ID1,ID2,ID3'` (what Swagger UI generates)

        Both formats are supported by the backend.
      example: ['650000000000000000000001', '650000000000000000000002']
